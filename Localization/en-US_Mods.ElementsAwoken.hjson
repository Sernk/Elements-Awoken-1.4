			Say9: I'm doing fine. I'm ABSOLUTELY DOING FINE. NOW STOP ASKING!
			Say8: You took down a being said to make others grow insane with alone it's presence. Are you even human?
			Say7: The fact that we never sleep is extremely strange. Who coded us to be this way?
			Say6: Your sanity is pretty low...you should maybe see a psychologist. Oh, wait...
			Say5: The townspeople seem plagued by hallucinations...luckily I am not. Anyways, who's your zombie friend there?
			Say4: To be honest, I'm surprised by the fact that you don't have an trauma - considering you fought an gigantic wall made out of flesh...
			Say3: Did you see my glasses? I can't seem to find them...oh, there they are. What do you want?
			Say2: I am the best psychologist around...and most likely the only one.
			Say1: I hear there is a 'Book of Shadows' that shows what is affecting your sanity. I'm sure it isnt as effective as my services.
			Say: And, how are we feeling today?

Bestiary: {
	Bosses: {
		VoidLeviathan: A serpentine beast from the depths of the Void, feared across all of Terraria. It hungers for a soul strong enough to reinforce its power even further...
		ElderShadeWyrm: An elder specimen of the Shade Wyrms, serpents from the depths of the Void, which have been granted enough time to evolve and grow to such enormous sizes and unpredictable power.
		RadiantMaster: What remained of the magicians succumbed to the relevations of the Radiant Rain now are mere soulless shells of what they used to be, existing for the sole purpose of protecting the Rain's further existence.
		WastelandBoss: Victim of an experiment gone terribly wrong, this scorpion was supposed to be a living weapon, able to smite all and everything in its path. The energy injected in its body began to take control of its brain, making the scorpion lose its mind.
		TheEye: One of the two parts split from the Guardian with the help of an energized vessel created by Lihzahrds during their battle, the Eye is imbued with the Guardian's mind and voice.
		AncientWyrm: One of the two parts split from the Guardian with the help of an energized vessel created by Lihzahrds during their battle, the Wyrm represents the Guardian's destructive nature.
		AqueousBoss: Now merely a shell of her former self, Aqueous once was one of the mightiest warriors to ever live in the Terran ocean, serving to the crown of the Sea King, the mutant known as Duke Fishron, before its murder. Rest assured, she will do whatever it takes to strike down whoever had slain her King...
		AzanaEyeBestiary: An unfortunate scientist, desperate to find a key to something powerful enough to end the Abraxis' tyrannical reign over Terraria, who discovered the Chaotron particles. This led to the creation of a full mechanical suit powered by these particles, which eventually consumed its creator.
		AzanaBestiary: An unfortunate scientist, desperate to find a key to something powerful enough to end the Abraxis' tyrannical reign over Terraria, who discovered the Chaotron particles. This led to the creation of a full mechanical suit powered by these particles, which eventually consumed its creator.
		CosmicObserverBestiary: After the ancient energies were released with the fall of a flesh abomination in the Underworld, some of this energy imbued the stones flying in the atmosphere, granting life to the Cosmic Observers.
		TheGuardian: The leader of the ancient species of Drakons, emerging from the vast depths of Terraria, who has been split into two parts through great pressure from an energized vessel created by Lihzahrds during their battle.
		TheGuardianFly: The leader of the ancient species of Drakons, emerging from the vast depths of Terraria, who has been split into two parts through great pressure from an energized vessel created by Lihzahrds during their battle.
		InfernaceBestiary: In the times long past, there was a civilization in the Depths of the Underworld, guarded by Infernace and his daughter, Furosia. However, while the civilization was razed to the ground aeons ago, Infernace still keeps his duty, despite being severely weakened.
		ObsidiousBoss: Originally an average mortal, Obsidious was a seeker of artifacts known to be mostly motivated by greed. In the end, his own greed, however, spelled doom upon him, when an ancient gemstone he coveted so much eventually caused him to get forever bound in stone.
		Permafrost: Virtually unrivalved spirit of frost and ice, Permafrost ruled his kingdom kindheartedly... Until one fateful day, when a race from the depths of the Void has invaded the Tundra, demolishing everything and everyone on their path, annihilating everything that Permafrost held dear, turning him vengeful.
		Regaroth: Believed to be the manifestation of lightning, Regaroth was created using essences of an entire army of Sky Elementals, with Abraxis empowering him even further, shaping it into the form it has now, a guardian of the upper layers of the atmosphere.
		ScourgeFighterBoss: Machine created by a team of Martian scientists who hoped to create their own equivalent of the mechanical beasts, in order to help them in the invasion of the Terrarian lands. Little did they know what could it eventually lead to...
		ToySlime: Originally created to be a harmless children's toy, it gained sentience and began wreaking havoc accross the land, thanks to the malevolent energies of the Frost Moon that rose at one fateful night.
		VolcanoxBoss: Ancient god of the Underworld, a primordial manifestation of fire, ash and magma, Volcanox created many of the terrors within the depths, such as the Wall of Flesh and Infernace.
		IzarisBoss: Crystalline terrors born many millenia ago in the depths of Terraria, driven by an insatiable thirst for power, who were stripped from their physical form centuries ago by Abraxis, having to instead take a form of a feeble, infirm old man, waiting for the hero to arrive.
		Kirvein: Crystalline terrors born many millenia ago in the depths of Terraria, driven by an insatiable thirst for power, who were stripped from their physical form centuries ago by Abraxis, having to instead take a form of a feeble, infirm old man, waiting for the hero to arrive.
		Krecheus: Crystalline terrors born many millenia ago in the depths of Terraria, driven by an insatiable thirst for power, who were stripped from their physical form centuries ago by Abraxis, having to instead take a form of a feeble, infirm old man, waiting for the hero to arrive.
		Xernon: Crystalline terrors born many millenia ago in the depths of Terraria, driven by an insatiable thirst for power, who were stripped from their physical form centuries ago by Abraxis, having to instead take a form of a feeble, infirm old man, waiting for the hero to arrive.
		AncientAmalgam: Thanks to the hero who had slain many of the great beasts of these lands, the Ancients are now fused again, stronger than ever before and hungering to seal the dark fate of not only Terraria, but the universe itself, becoming the unquestionable gods of this world...
		ShadeWyrm: Silent, albeit deadly, these serpents from the depths of the Void are one of the Dawn's main weapons. Given enough time, these beings may evolve into something much more powerful and intimidating...
	}

	Enemies: {
		Scorpion: This specimen of already unusually venomous desert scorpions was used in an experiment in order to turn it into a living weapon. Unleashing one in the sands of the desert might have detrimental consequences...
		VoidLeviathanOrb: A giant, bizarre orb, created by the Void Leviathan using its immense abilities. Inexplicably, the mere presence of such orb makes the serpent invulnerable to any physical attacks...
		Furosia: Daughter of the Infernace, once serving as a guardian of the civilization residing in the Depths, which has been razed to the ground many eons ago.
		RegarothMinion: Juvenile thunder serpent summoned by Regaroth to aid it in the battle. Do not be fooled by its sizes, for it can still be dangerous.
		MiniToySlime: Smaller version of a toy slime, which has broken away from a bigger one. It might still be dangerous despite its smaller size.
		Firefly: Blazing with unrestrained rage, this spirit with a shape reminiscent of a giant firefly will give it all to raze anyone and anything its master will command it to.
		AbyssSkull: Ambushers of the Dawn of the Void, furiously charging at any living being in their sight. They have their smaller brethren constantly orbiting them.
		AbyssSkullette: Tiny skulls orbiting their bigger brethren. Do not underestimate them simply because of their size, for they can outnumber anyone unprepared.
		AccursedFlier: Atrocious flying abominations, serving as an air support for other beasts of the Dawn. They have a reservoir of unknown fluid in their abdomens...
		DimensionalHive: Unlike all other Dawn's creatures, these hives don't attack on their own, but instead create an invisible aura that heals the Dawn's other hellspawns that are close enough to it.
		Immolator: Flying constructs born in the Void, having an eye with excellent perception capabilities in the middle of their frame that helps them easily track down any target.
		ReaverSlime: The Void has to offer a very wide array of monstrosities, and the slimes aren't the exception too. Needless to say, they are far more deadly than the other specimen of slimes...
		VoidKnight: Mindless rampagers of the Dawn, being able to conjure Void orbs around them as an additional mean of protection.
		VoidFly: Due their tiny sizes, these twisted insects rely exclusively on their sheer numbers, hoping to overwhelm their target.
		ZergCaster: Akin to all other beasts emerged from the Void, it is unknown what exactly is the source of their immense abilities.
		EtherealHunter: Terrifying wraiths from the dephts of the Void that will not leave any living creature safe from their deadly grip.
		VoidCrawler: Giant, many-legged spider-like creature that has a sack containing unknown liquid on its back.
		VoidGolem: Gargantuan brutes clad in a tough armor of Void's darkstone that smite everything that gets in their way. Their steps are so heavy that make the ground beneath them tremble as they move.
		VoidElemental: Dawn of the Void has to offer its own type of Elementals. However, unlike all other Elementals inhabiting Terraria, it is unknown how exactly these have emerged.
		RadiantWarrior: Mere mortals with will weak enough were one of the first beings to lose their minds and succumb to the Radiant Rain, which granted them immense abilities, but in return transformed them into its mindless slaves.
		SparklingSlime: Slimes were no exception to the revelations of the Radiant Rain, despite them not having any mind or will. Their bodies now consist of nothing but radiant powder with unimaginable potential.
		StarlightGlobule: Odd creature serving as a host to few smaller entities that will erupt from it, once the host is dead. Rather than being creatures assimilated by the Radiant Rain, they seem to be born from the Rain itself.
		AllKnower: Peculiar burrowing creatures, possessing great strength granted to them by the Radiant Rain, which also twisted them beyond comprehension.
		StellarStarfish: Sentient blobs of radiant powder, shaped akin to the ocean's starfishes, these entities seem to be born entirely out of the essence of the Radiant Rain.
		ArmoredTrencher: A cavern-dwelling worm of enormous sizes, clad in armor made of very tough scales, which seems to only have emerged after the fall of the false Cthulhu...
		DesertElemental: A being born out of the arcane energies of the sun-scorched desert, bearing a resemblance to a fallen warrior of the arid wastes.
		FireElemental: Fire Elemental - A restless spirit of the former inhabitant of the Underworld, roaming its ruins. They were sealed before, but once the Skeletron has fallen, they started to aimlessly roam the Underworld.
		FrostElemental: Disturbed spirit of the everfrozen Tundra that will give a chilly greeting to anyone daring to set foot in these frozen lands.
		SkyElemental: One of the many elementals, this one dwelling almost in the outer layers of the atmosphere, and will not hesitate to attack anyone they see as a threat.
		WaterElemental: Water spirit born out of the magical energies of the Terran ocean, shaped akin to a warrior from a long-lost civilization that once lived there.
		GiantVampireBat: With the ancient energies unleashed after the destruction of the ancient flesh amalgamation in the Underworld, vampire bats now can easily grow to enormous sizes, greatly increasing their deadliness.
		InfernoSpirit: A wrathful spirit of a previous inhabitant of the Dungneon, it became stronger than ever before with the fall of the Lord of the Moon.
		Pebleer: A tiny beetle, native to the Terrarian caverns. The shell on its back, resembling a pebble, helps it to blend with the surroundings, hiding itself from possible predators.
		Stoneer: A tiny beetle, native to the Terrarian caverns. The shell on its back, resembling a stone, helps it to blend with the surroundings, hiding itself from possible predators.
		DragonCharger: Powerful, blazing Drakonite-clad spirit that was unleashed after the destruction of an ancient flesh amalgamation in the Underworld.
		GreaterDrakoniteGolem: Despite being significantly more poweful than the Dragon Warrior, essentially this is still a remnant of the long-dead warrior, being brought back to life by Drakonite and the ancient energies now too.
		MagmaSlime: Now being a molten mix of lava and Drakonite, these slimes became dramatically more deadly and dangerous than ever before.
		DragonBat: Once a common cavern bat, this one got infused with Drakonite many years ago, under conditions unknown. The Drakonite shards in its body seem to allow it to utilize fire magic, in the form of fireballs.
		DragonSlime: One of the many creatures that under unclear circumstances got infused with Drakonite. This slime is covered in not only razor-sharp, but also blazing spikes, and getting hit with these is definitely going to hurt...
		DragonWarrior: Remnants of an unknown warrior, brought back to life seemingly by Drakonite shards that stick out of its armor like thorns.
		DrakoniteElemental: Unlike other cavern-dwelling creatures that were infused with Drakonite, the body of this one seems to consist solely of it.
		FlyingJaw: While visually similar to the Man Eaters, inhabiting both surface and underground Jungle, these flying creatures do not seem to actually be their relatives.
		PetalClasper: Spiders of these species, native to the Jungle, are a curious blend of flora and fauna. They bear a flower that emits a pleasant aroma on their backs.
		GiantTick: Cryptic giant insect with many eyes. Its body is made of even more enigmatic purple dust you have never seen before.
		MortemWalker: Enigmatic beast roving the lands. Upon dying it crumbles into purple dust which is as enigmatic as this creature itself.
		SkyCrawler: One of the incomprehensible entities which have emerged after the fall of the Moon's great Lord. Whenever it's damaged, its body pours strange purple dust.
		StellarBat: Peculiar winged creature, visually resembling a giant cavern bat. Its body seems to consist entirely out of a starborne metal...
		StellarCenturion: A being of unknown origin, clad in armor bearing a striking resemlbance to an archaic armor worn by warriors of some forgotten civilization, the armor being forged entirely out of a bizarre stellar metal.
		StellarEntity: Enigmatic entity shaped akin to an eye, covered in a tough shell made of the same metal as some other beings in the outer layers of the atmosphere.
		GiantToad: Despite looking like a normal toad that can be encountered in abundance in the Jungle, something feels off about this one...
		VampireBat: Close relative to the common cavern bat. However, the bites of the bats of this species can leech the lifeforce off the victim.
